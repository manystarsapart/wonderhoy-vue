import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './wonderhoy-app.vue'
const app = createApp(App)

// mounting to anb element with id "app"
app.mount('#app')



// note: still unsure about the deployment of the js code and app itself.
// the code above is probably wrong but i am just using an online compiler for now
